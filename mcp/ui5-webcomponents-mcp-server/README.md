# UI5 Web Components MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server for UI5 Web Components development.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Version v20.17.0, v22.9.0 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) Version v8.0.0 or higher
- An MCP client, such as VS Code (GitHub Copilot), Claude Code, Codex, or any other MCP-compatible client

## Setup

### Standard Configuration for Most Clients

This configuration works for most MCP clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary><i>Special configuration for native Windows</i></summary>
On native Windows (not WSL), you might need to prefix npx with `cmd /c`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "@ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx -y @ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Specific MCP Clients

Besides the general configuration outlined above, some MCP clients offer shortcuts for installing MCP servers.

#### VS Code

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"@ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server","type":"stdio","command":"npx","args":["-y","@ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server"]}'
```

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user ui5-webc-mcp-server -- npx -y @ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server
```

#### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add --transport stdio ui5-webc-mcp-server -- npx -y @ui5/webcomponents-mcp-server
```
