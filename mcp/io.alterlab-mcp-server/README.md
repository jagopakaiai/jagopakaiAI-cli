## Why AlterLab Instead of WebFetch or Browser MCP?

Claude's built-in `WebFetch` tool and open-source browser MCP servers fail on most real-world websites. They cannot bypass Cloudflare, render JavaScript SPAs, or extract structured data.

AlterLab replaces broken fetch tools with **one MCP server** that actually works:

| Capability | WebFetch / fetch() | Browser MCP | AlterLab MCP |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anti-bot bypass (Cloudflare, DataDome, Akamai) | No | Partial | Yes &mdash; automatic |
| JavaScript rendering (React, Angular, Vue SPAs) | No | Yes (slow) | Yes &mdash; headless Chromium |
| Structured data extraction (JSON, Schema.org) | No | No | Yes &mdash; built-in profiles |
| Smart tier escalation (cheapest method first) | N/A | N/A | Yes &mdash; saves 60-80% |
| Residential proxy rotation (195+ countries) | No | No | Yes |
| Screenshot and PDF capture | No | Screenshot only | Yes &mdash; both |
| OCR text extraction from images | No | No | Yes |
| Cost per request | Free (but fails) | Free (but slow) | From $0.0002 |

## How Does AlterLab Web Scraping Work?

AlterLab uses a multi-tier scraping architecture. It automatically selects the cheapest method capable of fetching each URL:

1. **Curl** ($0.0002/req) &mdash; Direct HTTP for static pages, RSS feeds, public APIs
2. **HTTP** ($0.0003/req) &mdash; TLS fingerprint rotation for moderately protected sites
3. **Stealth** ($0.0005/req) &mdash; Browser impersonation for Cloudflare/DataDome-protected sites
4. **Light JS** ($0.0007/req) &mdash; Lightweight JS extraction from server-rendered HTML
5. **Browser** ($0.001/req) &mdash; Full headless Chromium for JavaScript-heavy SPAs

Auto mode starts at Tier 1 and escalates only when blocked. Most websites resolve at Tiers 1-2, so **$1 gets you 1,000 to 5,000 scrapes** depending on the sites you target.

```

### `alterlab_create_session` &mdash; Create a Session

## Authenticated Scraping

AlterLab MCP supports scraping pages that require authentication. This enables AI agents to access user-specific content like order histories, account dashboards, and member-only pricing.

### How It Works

1. **Create a session** with cookies from a logged-in browser using `alterlab_create_session`
2. **Scrape authenticated pages** by passing the `session_id` to `alterlab_scrape`
3. **Manage sessions** with list, validate, and delete tools

### Example: Check Amazon Prime Pricing

```
User: "What's my Prime member price for this product?"

Claude: [calls alterlab_list_sessions → finds Amazon session]
Claude: [calls alterlab_scrape with session_id for authenticated pricing]
Claude: "The Prime member price is $24.99 (public price: $34.99)"
```

### Inline Cookies vs Stored Sessions

- **Stored sessions** (`session_id`): Best for repeated access to the same domain. Create once, reuse across requests.
- **Inline cookies** (`cookies`): Best for one-off authenticated requests where you don't need to save the session.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I add web scraping to Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf?

Install the AlterLab MCP server. For Claude Code, run `claude mcp add alterlab -- npx -y alterlab-mcp-server` and set your `ALTERLAB_API_KEY`. For Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf, add the JSON config block to your MCP settings file. Once configured, your AI assistant can scrape any URL, extract structured data, and take screenshots directly in conversation.

### Can Claude scrape websites that are behind Cloudflare or anti-bot protection?

Yes. AlterLab automatically handles Cloudflare, DataDome, PerimeterX, Akamai, and other anti-bot systems. It uses a multi-tier approach that starts with the cheapest method and escalates only when blocked. You don't need to configure anything &mdash; anti-bot bypass is fully automatic.

### What is an MCP server and how does it work with Claude?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. An MCP server is a small program that exposes tools &mdash; like web scraping &mdash; that Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf can call during a conversation. The AlterLab MCP server gives your AI assistant 5 tools: scrape, extract, screenshot, estimate cost, and check balance.

### How is AlterLab different from Firecrawl, ScrapingBee, or Apify MCP servers?

AlterLab starts at $0.0002 per request &mdash; 5-20x cheaper than most scraping APIs &mdash; because it only uses expensive browser rendering when a site actually requires it. Smart tier escalation means you pay for what each site needs, not the maximum. AlterLab also includes built-in structured data extraction with pre-built profiles (product, article, job posting, etc.) at no extra cost.

### Can I scrape Amazon, Walmart, and other e-commerce sites from Claude?

Yes. AlterLab handles all major e-commerce anti-bot protection. Use the `alterlab_extract` tool with `extraction_profile: "product"` to get structured JSON: product name, price, currency, rating, review count, availability, and images &mdash; ready for analysis, comparison, or data pipelines.

### Can Cursor scrape documentation and generate code from it?

Yes. With AlterLab MCP installed in Cursor, you can ask it to scrape API documentation, library docs, or any reference page and generate TypeScript types, API clients, or component code from the live content. This is more reliable than relying on the LLM's training data, which may be outdated.

### Does AlterLab MCP work with JavaScript-heavy sites (React, Angular, Vue)?

Yes. Use `render_js: true` or set `mode: "js"` to enable full headless Chromium rendering. AlterLab renders the complete page including all JavaScript, waits for dynamic content to load, then extracts content from the fully rendered DOM. This works for React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, and any other JavaScript framework.

### What output format is best for AI and LLM context windows?

Use markdown (the default). It preserves document structure &mdash; headings, tables, lists, links &mdash; while being 60-80% smaller than raw HTML. Claude, GPT-4, and other LLMs process markdown significantly better than HTML. AlterLab's markdown output is specifically optimized for LLM context windows.

### Is there rate limiting?

Free-tier accounts have rate limits. Adding any balance removes rate limits. The MCP server includes automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient rate limit errors (429).

### Can I use this MCP server for large-scale scraping?

Yes. The MCP server processes one request at a time through the conversation interface, but you can build agentic workflows that scrape many URLs sequentially. For batch processing, use the AlterLab API directly or the [n8n integration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-alterlab).

---

## Error Handling

The MCP server returns helpful error messages with suggested next actions:

| Error | What Happens | Suggested Action |
|---|---|---|
| **401** Unauthorized | Invalid API key | Check `ALTERLAB_API_KEY` is set correctly |
| **402** Insufficient Credits | Balance too low | Run `alterlab_check_balance`, add funds |
| **403** Forbidden | Site blocked the request | Try `render_js: true` + `use_proxy: true` |
| **429** Rate Limited | Too many requests | Automatic retry with backoff |
| **504** Gateway Timeout | Scrape took too long | Increase `timeout`, simplify request |

---

## Agentic Workflows — AI Agents That Scrape the Web

AlterLab MCP turns any AI agent into a web-capable agent. Instead of relying on stale training data, your agent can fetch live information from any website during execution.

### Use Cases for AI Agents

- **Research agents** — scrape multiple sources, cross-reference facts, generate reports with citations
- **Data pipeline agents** — extract structured product/pricing/job data on a schedule
- **Competitive intelligence** — monitor competitor pages, track pricing changes, detect new features
- **Content generation** — scrape real data to ground LLM output in facts, not hallucinations
- **Lead enrichment** — scrape company websites to enrich CRM records with live data
- **Compliance monitoring** — check regulatory pages, terms of service, and policy updates

### Compatible AI Frameworks and Clients

Works with any tool that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol):

- **Claude Desktop** / **Claude Code** — Anthropic's AI assistant
- **Cursor** — AI-powered code editor
- **Windsurf** — Codeium's AI IDE
- **Cline** — VS Code AI assistant
- **GitHub Copilot** — via MCP configuration
- **Custom agents** — any framework using the MCP SDK (Python, TypeScript, Go)
- **n8n** — workflow automation via [n8n-nodes-alterlab](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-alterlab)
